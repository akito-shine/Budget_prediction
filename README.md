# Budget_prediction
This is my own project that I did during my internship at Yoma Strategic Holdings. The project predicts how many participants will take part in campaigns and helps campaign planners know how to distribute and optimize the budget from the prediction data and hence, leading to a reduction of cost for the campaign.
